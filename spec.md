I will do the  LINE chat bot

The LINE chat bot is designed for finding the face mask

Basiclly, there are three levels of the LINE chat bot
1. Districts 2. Stores 3. Detail Information of face mask
---------------------------------------------------------

While the user text something about districts, the LINE chat bot would reply a list of store's name which have face mask selling in this district

While the user text the store name, the LINE chat bot would reply different types of face mask are selling in this store

While the user text the type of face mask, the LINE chat bot would reply the number of face mask selling and the price 

In order to find out exact location of the store, i would like to design the new store name which combine with the districts.

In this way, we can make each stroes name become unique(for same store name for different districts).

At this time, this is simple design of chat bot. But i would update the detail design after i find out a good service to integrate into your chatbot.
thx
